onStart = Hi! You can use me to ping any host to check if target is up.\nI work also as inline bot!\nRun /help command if you need further explanations!
onHelp = Hello! I can run ping command.\nI can ping hosts in two ways: using _inline queries_ and using _/ping_ command. You can specify the target by using IP address (ie: `31.192.93.8`) or hostname (ie: `google.com`).\n\n_Inline query_: if you choose this way, I can immediatly tell you whether the host is reachable or not. if you press on the result, I will show you ping details performed with 2 packets of data and a timeout of 1s each.\nplease notice that with inline mode, I wait for 1 second (option -w in unix ping command) to get a response: if there are no results then I assume the target is *not available*. \n\n_command_ /ping: using this command I will ping the host you specified with 3 packets of data using a timeout of 1s each. Also in this case, I stop the process after 3 seconds of getting no results. Usage is very simple: works either with /ping and _ping_. \nAs instance, you can run `/ping google.com` or `ping 31.192.28.1`.\n\n_Please notice_ that some hosts may have disabled responses to PING to avoid ping flooding... so I can't exactly tell you whether a host is up or not.
fastPingFailed = Ping failed: no pong received, maybe you are pinging the wrong host...
pingFailed = Ping failed: no pong received, is it a valid host address..?
